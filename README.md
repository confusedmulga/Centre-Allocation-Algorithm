# IBPS Centre Allocation Algorithm üè´üìã

A scalable and intelligent desktop application to automate large-scale exam center and slot allocation for IBPS-style exams (Prelims, Mains, Interviews), built for handling over 2 million candidates across thousands of centers with smart preference, gender, and logistics rules.

---

## üîß Purpose

This project was designed to solve a real-world logistical challenge: **allocating exam centers and time slots for lakhs of students**, while balancing gender ratios, travel constraints, and accessibility rules. It aims to serve organizations like IBPS, UPSC, or state-level recruitment boards conducting exams at scale.

## ‚úÖ Key Features

### üì• Input Handling
- Upload **Student Data** (`.csv`, `.xlsx`) with fields: name, address, registration number, gender, disability %, preferred city, etc.
- Upload **Center Data** (`.csv`, `.xlsx`) with fields: center name, location, capacity per slot, type (small/large).
- Set **Exam Dates**, **Slot Configurations**, and **Control Parameters**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Smart Allocation Logic
- **Priority Rules**: Disabled > Female > Male.
- **Gender Ratio Enforcement**: 50:50 until 4PM; post that, flexible.
- **Distance-based fallback**: If preferred city is full, fallback to nearest center within 300 km.
- **Consecutive Exam Distance Rule**: Ensures back-to-back exam candidates aren‚Äôt moved more than 400 km.
- **State vs National Level Toggle**: Assigns centers based on exam scope.
- **Overflow Handling**: Alerts user if centers/days are insufficient for the batch.

### üìä Preview & Export
- Preview exam summary before generating.
- Final allocation is exported as an Excel file with:
  - Candidate name
  - Registration number
  - Allocated center & address
  - Slot timing
  - Roll number
  - System-generated password (optional)
  - Future-ready for Barcode/Admit card generation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/IBPS-Center-Allocator.git
cd IBPS-Center-Allocator
````

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

```bash
